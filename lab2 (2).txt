Lab 2 

The labs should be done using what we've learned so far ONLY. I don't want to see any functions nor classes nor objects !!!

The objectif is to practice what we've learned so far.    After all, PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT!  

Easy (yes it is a 2D array) 
MENU2D 

A restaurant has a menu, each menu has multiple items, each items has the following fields: 
Item name, Item price and Item rate. 
Create a 2D array Menu containing the items informations. 

Array should look something like this:   
Menu
Item 0: Kebab 	9.99 	5 
Item 1: Beef 	6.99 	7 
Item 2: Chicken 4.00 	9 
Item 3: Beer 	0.99 	10   

When your program starts, the menu should contain some items, ask the user if he wants to enter new items, 
if so get then the new item and add it to the menu until the users finishes, 
then print out the menu in your console.
Hint: Your 2D array will be a String array. 

===================================================================================================  


Medium (depends on if you go the easy way or the long way, but the long way could be pretty long!) 
NUMBA2LETTERS 

Create a program that ask the user for a number (0-1000) and then returns that number in word.   
ex: 100 = One hundred
Challenge: Numbers from 0 1 trillions (if you did it the good way, it should be a walk down the aisle :D)
===================================================================================================

Hard (not really, just a little bit longer :) ) 
PHONE BOOK 

Create a phone book with a couple of entries. 
Give the user the following options 

1. Add 
Which lets the user add a new entry to the phonebook Name and Phone number 

2. Edit 
Which lets the user edit an existed entry 

3. Delete 
Which lets the user delete an existed entry 

4. Display 
Which would display all the entries 

5. Exit
Which would exit the program   

====================================================================================================

User's entry validation is expected for all 3 programs 
Unless stated otherwise, you are allow to use 1D, 2D or 3D Arrays 
All programs should be extendable for we will be using them later on
